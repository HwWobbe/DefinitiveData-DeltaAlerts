# DefinitiveData-DeltaAlerts
* provide examples of "Definitive Data"; most especially those that support the developing Address Management Authority
* Discuss the reasons for Changes (Deltas) that should trigger "Alerts".
* emphasize that "shared" alerts are more economical ... $0.80/#1.00 @ N=2
* Discuss various Use Cases.  Eventually these should be posted to LinkedIn.
* GPS = latitude + Longitude, as opposed to (proprietary, per CPC) Postal Code.
* This should likely link to DgH to start and then DocsH
* Can Juergen help with this technology?
* Consider using to WayBack machine to access (lost) content (that I still consider "definitive").
