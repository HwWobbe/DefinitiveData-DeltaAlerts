## 2022-10-: Due times
* -10-01: priority review(s)
* review -09- Notes

## 2022-09-: Activities & Notes
* -09-29: unprecedented DbServerD recovered.  Distraction ends.
* -09-25: re-balancing 'Planning' and 'Doing', mindful of GTD
* * Considering the (less Pulse) use of GISTS
* Continue to restructure this material into Reports for each group of participants.
* * add more Topics
* * start to incorporate Anki
* * * introduce Anki to aid occasional colaborators
* * * * some Teams types may find this useful
* -09-19: review https://docs.github.com/en/pages
* * distinguish the uses of GISTS and Repois
* -09-09:
* * -09-05: testing the new uses of Slack
* * recommend AdManCa hire a couple of interns.
* * * structure these evaluation jobs for junior or master levels.
* spawn a portion of this README as a separate file in the AdManCa repos ; retrieve and incorporate via a PR.
* * confirm or refute: a File is the elemental first-class unit of content for PRs.
* * -09-01: one way of determining any file size limits that might apply is to simply start building larger consolidated files that can be accessed via the prioposed IndeX file
* * * it may also be effective to pull the repo down to a desktop and review the files in that environment
* * -08-25: Copyrights & TradeMarks considerations may be needed, in spite of Open Source committments.


# 2022-09: Topics:
* GISTS can be used to reduce Pulse noise caused by frequent updates

## Mehregan:
* Mehregan productivity is compelling attention
* * This is likely to be a protracted adoption since it is still Version 0...

## Slack:
* Ideally, Slack will help Focus on the most Urgent collaborative activities
* * Summaries will then focus on the most Important
* * * more MarkUp use will also help this Focus effort
* * * * as might more use of Color
* * * * and inline Links
* * There are prequisite activities:
* * this may be accelarated by the development of a Slack messages prototype
* * * -09-05: boot-strapping is underway.
* * * * it may be time to use Commits as Summary points rather than Activity points
* * * * * review and revise the methodologies for localHost work
* * * * * re-consider GitLab since Slack integration seems to be restricted to Organizations.

# 4. Introduction: > Background: > DoneTimes: 2022-09: ...
* started adding Topics to these Notes
* -09-03: started creating a Slack channel for the AdManCa Team(s)
* * strive to link these as effectively as possible
* * Notion may be an easier initiation path for less-technical collaborators

* -09-01: ...
* * consider building an Index page that links to appropriate sections of other GotHub file like this
* * * a simpler Git page might be more accessible

# 2022-08:
* -08-22: a bit of a time crunch has been imposed, so daily Pulse comments may be reduced
* -08-24: still crunched for the rest of this week

### -08-20: checking the new TiddlyHub design
* This slight changing in the use of titles seems appealing.
* * ( Splash with an image )SwAi? - in order to achieve PoTda ( standardized from PoTd )EdD
* * * PoTda - P(icture) o(f the) Tda(y)
* * * this type of pseudoCode is becoming more significant now that TW has:
* * * * SPLIT okperators for improved parsing
* * * * CASCADE logic rules
### -08-21.
<hr>

* The use of Hypothesis as a reminder/workflow systemn seems effective.
* * this should still be drived by ( ControlPoint )TwH logic
* * Trying to annotate pages that need attention in a manner similar to that used at DebateGraph.
* * * review DynaList too.
## -08-16: a BlownAway.ByTiddlyWiki ( BaByTw ) contest is an idea worth exploring.
* one possible focus is a melding of AdManCa credibility ; Google's OpenSource PlusCodes, YOTI - Your Own Trusted Identity
* -08-15: Encouraging others to consider my interests in Identity Management products

## -08-14:
* Linking more possible collaborators in order to build out an Adress Management network that is interested in the DefData ("Definitieve Data") aspects of DataIntegrity and Election Integrity.
* investigate: PRs as a Transclusion, more deeply since this is an obvious capability that should be in a SVC system
## -08-11:
* Considering e-wallet collaborations for Identity apps that need better Address information.
* * this may well fit into the proposed Voting Initiatives Laboratory infrastructure
* * * active discussions and deliberations are underway

## -08-09: 
The majority of the maintenance having been completed, it is finally time to restucture this material for a diverse set of Audiences.  Ideally, the use of a proper SVC will make this easy enough, so that it is possible to harvest some benefits from the infrastructure.

Start by:
* trying to pull a small update into this repo

<hr>

## 2022-08-2?: 
#### Demonstrate the value of a modern Canadian Address Management infrastructure that can be use as a definitive reference for all possible Canadian Addresses.

#####  DeltaAlerts
DeltaAlerts are being built as an infrastructure based on https://maps.google.com/pluscodes/

* Investigate the potetial interactions between pulic/private repos via PullRequests
** The end product will be OpenSource, but working teams are likely to need some private Comment areas.

#### Drive Content creation via PullRequests.
...

## 2022-07-31:
### Started to re-package this for ...Inititives.

# â‘  ...DeltaAlerts

# Privacy & Technology

Technology leads Legislation and the already large gaps are more likely to grow than shrink, given current trends.  Individual Subjects should, therefore, consider their particular needs and views, as well as how to position themselves within the societies they are part of.  This is particulary important given the current trends of moving data into the Cloud.
After all, Facebook has clearly demonstrated that its approach to data collection is harmful to its users and that the Subjects who do not protect themselves will inevitably be just "collateral damage" to its business model.

Subjects are becoming intolerant of the need to protect themselves from privacy breaches at sites that collect and, when breached, expose Personal data.

In a programmer's view, DefinitiveData is simply the best available data for a particular algorithm.  This "best" judgement is, of course, highly context sensitive, with many diverse opinions and vested interests, including those of many DefDataContexts that need reconciliation in order to optimize the value of required investment(s).  Consider, for example, ...

* Canadian Cities as the "owners" of Municipal addresses.
* Canada Post (since most Canadians, incorrectly, believe Canada Post knows where they live).
* Government Institutions at all three levels ( & especially the Voting Authorities )
* Canadian Banks and their K.Y.C (Know Your Customer) needs
* The National Association of Mail Users ( NAMMU )
* Mailers ( and their mail services providers )
* Mail Recipients ( likely a bigger market than Mailers, as junkMail grows and Privacy meeds increase > wikiLink )
* AdManCa = Ad(dres) Man(agement) Ca(nada) & FirstNations

* Standardization will be increasingly important as more Devs engage.
* * there is an Organization that sets Real Estate standards.
* * * link pending
* * Address Quality issues are more widely recognized given recent ArtificialIntelligence and BigData hyperbole.
* * * the American VoteByMail examples and opinions will be informative
* * * * DebateGraph may be an effective tool in the imminent political Debates.
* * Privacy issues are likely to demand more attention given the impact of CoVid19 on traditional Voting practices.

* * have a secure AWS vault created, that can be assumed via credentials.
* * * pick a name
* * * consider possible backdoors.

# DefinitiveData-DeltaAlerts
The growing availability of data actually appears to be creating demands for even more data, almost as if a cyclone of data gathering forces is engaging to feed into the promise of Artificial Intelligence engines.  One result of this whirlwind of activity is a dramatic increase in redundant data acquisition and data matching efforts. ...

* A national Productivity issue with Identity implications, introduced at ...
* (https://debategraph.org/Stream.aspx?nid=596285&vt=bubble&dc=focus)
* Enumerate the fields of endeavour which will be increasingly affected by defData ...
* ... e.g. Voting, Banking, ... = Identity protection and management ; MyRep ... R(ights) e(ntitlements) p(iviledges)

* Expound the need for EnduringLinks to alleviate Matching problems

* GPS = latitude + Longitude, as opposed to (proprietary, per CPC) Postal Code.

<hr>

* Benefits need to be confirmed
* CPC: URM cost savings
