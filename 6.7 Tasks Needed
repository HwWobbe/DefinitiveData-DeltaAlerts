"Tasks Needed" are work assignments that become apparent during the conduct of the activities in the current Project. Such tasks are generally not trivial enough to be simply completed.  Instead, the effort to complete them may need to be edferred into a subsequent Maror Release, Minor Versiion, or Patch.
